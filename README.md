///UPGRADE SCRIPT\\\

***Please note that, 

-address,username and password sections are filled in meaninglessly at the code line.

-"new_version" section define the folder name while creating new folder.

-"main_method()" created for the thread.Thread has started to work through the "main_method" which trigger the other processes.

-"upgrade files" which should be send with FTP should be where the script is running.

Regards
